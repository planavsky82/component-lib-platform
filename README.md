# @planit/design-system Development Platform

Start your own Design System development platform in minutes!

As explained by the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/), a design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels.

There are various parts of a design system that are necessary:

1. Clearly documented design standards
2. The utilization of a design tooling platform like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) to provide assets to Designers
3. A component library to implement the system standards and abstract patterns to ensure consistency across applications 
4. Development documentation with rich examples of component utilization within an application
5. A CSS framework that defines tokens utilized by the design tooling and component library

A design system is *not* purely technical, so this NPM package is *not* everything you need. It focues on numbers 3, 4, and 5. When a development platform is paired with an equally strong design platform, its a recipe for success.
